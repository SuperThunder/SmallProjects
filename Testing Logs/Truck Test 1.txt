Ran basic program that used only two front wheels, and then both front and rear
Front only: Ran for 1000ms at power 50, did not move truck significantly
Front+Rear: Front motors and rear motors rotated in different directions at power 50 for 1000ms, causing no movement but a lot of strained noises

Note: Front wheel axles may need to be redesigned, as they have a small tendency to detach
