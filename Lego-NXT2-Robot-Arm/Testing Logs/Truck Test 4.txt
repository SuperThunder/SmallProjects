This test was done with a motor control Android app, where with a multitouch screen you can control each motor in real time by hand.
Front motors both responded well. However, the rear motor showed issues both with the motor and its gearing.

The motor itself became "stuck" (it appeared to be stuck in the braking position, despite input).
This was fixed by unplugging its control / power line, spinning it manually a bit, and plugging the line back in.
The motor's gear experience issues with staying meshed both due to the geometry of the design and the fact the motor wobbled slightly.

However, the front two motors are still able to easily pull the whole truck and crane weight when the rear wheels are disconnected from the motor and allowed to spin freely.
