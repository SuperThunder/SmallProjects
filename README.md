A basic and buggy python trigonometry calculator.


HISTORY--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

05/08/14: Got it working somewhat for right angled triangles after going on a grand adventure with globals, locals, returns and lists.

06/14: Started programming this on a R-Pi while playing CS:GO. Neither my K/D nor my code were good. Before taking a long break fixed an UnboundLocalError and broke everything else.
