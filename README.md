==========

A basic and buggy python trigonometry calculator.


HISTORY--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

06/08/14: Renovations to the side input system, simplified some stuff. Started to work on the 8+ cases or w/e that are needed to actually solve every case of a triangle.
BIG IDEA: Rewrite so that we have a triangle class with the variables and solving functions, then a triangle object in which the variables values get entered with the object __init__. (credits to jondb)

05/08/14: Got it working somewhat for right angled triangles after going on a grand adventure with globals, locals, returns and lists.

06/14: Started programming this on a R-Pi while playing CS:GO. Neither my K/D nor my code were good. Before taking a long break fixed an UnboundLocalError and broke everything else.
