Due Date: Tuesday March 10th 2015
Needed Changes: Use individual variables instead of arrays (why....)[DONE], ability to individually reroll[DONE], simple AI for auto rerolling of specific die[DONE!!!]

Good AI reroll added, works well except for small quirk of when choosing between two equally commmon values will take the lower one as it starts from the lower ones and if it does not find a larger one more common than it it has no reason to switch.
