Due Date: Monday March 9th 2015
Needed Changes: Use individual variables instead of arrays (why....)[DONE], ability to individually reroll[DONE], simple AI for auto rerolling of specific die
	-> should implement reroll and AI first then convert to arrays as later program will need to be reconverted to arrays (WHYYYYYYYYYYYY)
